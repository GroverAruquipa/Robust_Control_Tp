# Robust Control TP's

In this repository the scripts for the Robust Control Tps presented for the Master 2 in robotics and microrobotics UBFC-SIS are attached.

## TP 1

Analysis of stability and dynamics of systems with uncertainty.

```matlab
TP1 folder
```

## TP2
Robust driver synthesis H-infinity and mu-synthesis
```matlab
#  Tp2 Folder

```

## TP3

Analysis and synthesis of robust controllers using mu-synthesis and h-infinity
```matlab
parameters_robot.m
hinf_robot.m % For the H infinity synthesis
mu_robot.m % For the mu synthesis
stability_robot.m % Stability analysis of the close loop
wcp_robot.m % the worst case with uncerteinities
```
These works are based on the book Robust control Design with MATLAB.
